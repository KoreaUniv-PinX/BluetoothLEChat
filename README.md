Bluetooth Low Energy Chat example
=================================
I took the original Bluetoot Chat example from Google and modified it to run
as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) GATT service.

This is just a proof of concept to see how the Android BLE API works in a real world, and test some use-cases/scenarios like:
* Connect devices and see how much can we done without user interactions
* Advertising ranges
* Test transfer rate speeds
* Mixing Bluetooth Classic with Bluetooth LE
* ...


Do not expect a production-like code, don't even expect a fully working program.
The point of this experiment is just for researching Bluetooth capabillities on Android devices, not to deliver a messenger app.

Enjoy!
